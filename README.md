# TensorFlow Exercise

In this exercise, we will look at Deep Learning using TensorFlow. We'll use the Bank Authentication Data Set from the UCI repository.

The dataset consists of 5 columns:

    variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
    skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
    curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
    entropy of image (continuous)
    class (integer)

Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.
